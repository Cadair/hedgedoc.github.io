title: Why was the PDF Export feature removed?
---

We used a chrome-headless instance to generate the PDFs, but that led to some security vulnerabilities and was therefore deactivated. There are currently plans to re-add this feature in a safe way, but this will most likely take some time and can be expected at the earliest with 2.1 (but could also take longer).

In the meantime you can use your browsers print to PDF Feature. This [page](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-save-a-webpage-as-a-pdf/) explains how to do that for multiple browsers.
